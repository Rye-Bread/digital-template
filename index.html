<h2>Warplane Wargame of War |Defensive War III| (Readme)</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Bullet hell game.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
A fun experience, where they shoot things.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
It's a bullet hell game, and can be quite difficult if you don't do it right.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
You can go left and right, and you can shoot bullets. Use the arrow keys for left and right and spacebar to shoot MIGHTY JUSTICE UPON OUR FOES THAT THEY MAY BE SMOTE UPON THE HILLS IN A GLORIOUS THERMOPILE OF SCRAP AND CONFLAGRATION.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
To change boring invaders into a more fun Sh'm'up game.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
It has all-new super duper proprietary War-GFX enabled.
Additionally, The following game mechanics have been implemented from scratch:
    -Enemies fire faster the fewer there are of them.
    -Your weapon has a heat indicator, and although it fires quickly in short bursts it will quickly overheat and fire much more slowly.
    -Enemies will not only descend towards you, but this runs on a random chance, they will sometimes move back up.
    (5 chances of going down, two chances up)
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
So we have the Pithonites, who like war, and really only make peace to prepare for more war. You play as a pilot of the peace loving Jarva. Jarvanians will always agree to a truce or a peace treaty when available, and are not especially bright when it comes to repeat offences; damn if Jarva doesn't singlehandedly have the world's best airforce though.
    Jarva's national anthem:
    I like justice, I like peace, a female nephew, is called a niece.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
For years, there was peace.. A shaky truce, but peace nonetheless. I swear, making peace with those blasted warmongering Pithons was too good to be true, especially after the first war... and the broken peace when they invaded again for the second war.... Seems like they've invaded a third time, pilot, and it's your job to make sure the entire invasion force doesn't cross the border. Show them that we will not stop until there is peace again....
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
People that like bullet hell games.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
A few minutes at most, under thirty seconds if you're good.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Dodge'n'shoot.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
    Textures:   Either from phaser examples or publicly available on the web, and all were edited in some way.
    Sound :     All from phaser examples.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I took the phaser example game Invaders, and changed it.
</li>
    
<li><strong>Notes:</strong>
-Spent a lot of time trying to implement pausing, it wasn't working out very well so I cut trying to add it.
-Due to how tweens are programmed in phaser, or at the very least due to the way the tween and other code is programmed in the space invaders example, every time you click to restart the invaders will move faster and faster each time. I tried for hourse to work it into a controllable feature, but it didn't work out. Therefore, if you truly want to start over at (level 1), refresh the page. Like I said, no matter if you win or lose the current level, the invaders seem to keep going faster, and I couldn't do anything about it.
-If I had more time, I would add rockets, and possibly improve the movment patterns of the invaders, allowing them to suddenly jink. I would also try to implement pausing and level progression (If the tweens cooperated.)
